  abstract = {A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp\{iγ(C)\} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

title = {Disorder effects in topological states: Brief review of the recent developments*},
journal = {Chinese Physics B},
abstract = {Disorder inevitably exists in realistic samples, manifesting itself in various exotic properties for the topological states. In this paper, we summarize and briefly review the work completed over the last few years, including our own, regarding recent developments in several topics about disorder effects in topological states. For weak disorder, the robustness of topological states is demonstrated, especially for both quantum spin Hall states with Z2 = 1 and size induced nontrivial topological insulators with Z2 = 0. For moderate disorder, by increasing the randomness of both the impurity distribution and the impurity induced potential, the topological insulator states can be created from normal metallic or insulating states. These phenomena and their mechanisms are summarized. For strong disorder, the disorder causes a metal–insulator transition. Due to their topological nature, the phase diagrams are much richer in topological state systems. Finally, the trends in these areas of disorder research are discussed.}

abstract = {Low dimensionality offers a unique opportunity to introduce some relevant concepts of solid state physics, keeping the treatment at a simple level. This chapter begins with the presentation of the Bloch theorem for one-dimensional periodic lattices. A peculiar aspect of the energy spectrum of an electron in a periodic potential is the presence of allowed and forbidden energy regions. One-dimensional approaches are particularly suited to show from different points of view (weak binding, tight-binding, quantum tunneling, continued fractions) the mechanism of formation of energy bands in solids. The focus of this chapter is on one-dimensional periodic potentials, with traditional contributions going back to the early times of the foundation of quantum mechanics; brief digressions are given to evidence the conceptual link between this historical area of solid state and other much younger and very active areas of research such as artificial structures and superlattices, photonic crystals, atomic condensates.}
