title = {Revival of the magnetoelectric effect},
journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {Recent research activities on the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect—induction of magnetization by an electric field or of polarization by a magnetic field—are reviewed. Beginning with a brief summary of the history of the ME effect since its prediction in 1894, the paper focuses on the present revival of the effect. Two major sources for ‘large’ ME effects are identified. (i) In composite materials the ME effect is generated as a product property of a magnetostrictive and a piezoelectric compound. A linear ME polarization is induced by a weak ac magnetic field oscillating in the presence of a strong dc bias field. The ME effect is large if the ME coefficient coupling the magnetic and electric fields is large. Experiments on sintered granular composites and on laminated layers of the constituents as well as theories on the interaction between the constituents are described. In the vicinity of electromechanical resonances a ME voltage coefficient of up to 90 V cm−1 Oe−1 is achieved, which exceeds the ME response of single-phase compounds by 3–5 orders of magnitude. Microwave devices, sensors, transducers and heterogeneous read/write devices are among the suggested technical implementations of the composite ME effect. (ii) In multiferroics the internal magnetic and/or electric fields are enhanced by the presence of multiple long-range ordering. The ME effect is strong enough to trigger magnetic or electrical phase transitions. ME effects in multiferroics are thus ‘large’ if the corresponding contribution to the free energy is large. Clamped ME switching of electrical and magnetic domains, ferroelectric reorientation induced by applied magnetic fields and induction of ferromagnetic ordering in applied electric fields were observed. Mechanisms favouring multiferroicity are summarized, and multiferroics in reduced dimensions are discussed. In addition to composites and multiferroics, novel and exotic manifestations of ME behaviour are investigated. This includes (i) optical second harmonic generation as a tool to study magnetic, electrical and ME properties in one setup and with access to domain structures; (ii) ME effects in colossal magnetoresistive manganites, superconductors and phosphates of the LiMPO4 type; (iii) the concept of the toroidal moment as manifestation of a ME dipole moment; (iv) pronounced ME effects in photonic crystals with a possibility of electromagnetic unidirectionality. The review concludes with a summary and an outlook to the future development of magnetoelectrics research.}

It provides an efficient method of computing (spin) Hall conductances without specifying gauge-fixing conditions. We demonstrate that it correctly reproduces quantized Hall conductances even on a coarsely discretized Brillouin zone. A gauge-dependent integer-valued field, which plays a key role in the formulation, is evaluated in several gauges. An extension to the non-Abelian Berry connection is also given. }

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

title = {Disorder effects in topological states: Brief review of the recent developments*},
journal = {Chinese Physics B},
abstract = {Disorder inevitably exists in realistic samples, manifesting itself in various exotic properties for the topological states. In this paper, we summarize and briefly review the work completed over the last few years, including our own, regarding recent developments in several topics about disorder effects in topological states. For weak disorder, the robustness of topological states is demonstrated, especially for both quantum spin Hall states with Z2 = 1 and size induced nontrivial topological insulators with Z2 = 0. For moderate disorder, by increasing the randomness of both the impurity distribution and the impurity induced potential, the topological insulator states can be created from normal metallic or insulating states. These phenomena and their mechanisms are summarized. For strong disorder, the disorder causes a metal–insulator transition. Due to their topological nature, the phase diagrams are much richer in topological state systems. Finally, the trends in these areas of disorder research are discussed.}

abstract = {Low dimensionality offers a unique opportunity to introduce some relevant concepts of solid state physics, keeping the treatment at a simple level. This chapter begins with the presentation of the Bloch theorem for one-dimensional periodic lattices. A peculiar aspect of the energy spectrum of an electron in a periodic potential is the presence of allowed and forbidden energy regions. One-dimensional approaches are particularly suited to show from different points of view (weak binding, tight-binding, quantum tunneling, continued fractions) the mechanism of formation of energy bands in solids. The focus of this chapter is on one-dimensional periodic potentials, with traditional contributions going back to the early times of the foundation of quantum mechanics; brief digressions are given to evidence the conceptual link between this historical area of solid state and other much younger and very active areas of research such as artificial structures and superlattices, photonic crystals, atomic condensates.}
